//lmao C# basics

//if you want something to be true, or have a specific value, then you can use if statements

//heres an example:
if (LimbBehaviour.Health == 0f) 
{ 
    //code here
}

//inside the if statement, you see a "=="
//its REQUIRED to use "==" in an if statement
//you could use > or <
//if you dont want something to be true then use this:

if (!LimbBehaviour.IsZombie == true) //notice the "!" before we define what we want
{ 
    //code here
}

//theres also ">=" (greater than or equal to)
//and "<=" (less than or equal to)
